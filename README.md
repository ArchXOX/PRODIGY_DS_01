Dataset chosen from Kaggle is the 'Student Performance Factors' dataset. 
Contains different variables like Extracurricular activities, Parental Involvement, etc in relation to a student's performance in the exams.
For the first task, I have chosen the categorical variable - 'Parental education level' to represent using a bar graph, whose categories are
'High school', 'College' and 'Postgraduate'.

Select 'Open in Colab' to get a better view.
